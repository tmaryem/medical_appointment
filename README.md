Introduction 

The goal of this project is to investigate and analyze a dataset of medical appointments collected from Brazil public hospitals. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to their appointments or not. 

The analysis will focus on finding the possible reasons behind showing or no showing of the patients to the medical appointments.  Using the descriptive statistics and Python, we will answer the following questions:

- What's the percentage of patient that show up for their appointment?
- Does the gender affect the patient's show up?
- Does the age affect the patient's show up?
- Who care most for their health, Female or Male, old age or youth?
- Does having a Scholarship affect the patient's show up?
- How the diseases impact the patientâ€™s show up?
- Does Neighborhood affect the patient's show up?
- Does Receiving SMS affect the patient's show up?
- Does the time between schedule day and appointment day affect the patient's show up?

To analyze the medical appointment no show, we will follow these main steps:

- Data Wrangling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Data Visualizations.
- Draw Conclusion.

Tools

- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
